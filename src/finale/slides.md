## Now Think About Software

-   Software can and should be critiqued in the same way as a bicycle:

    - Does it do what it's supposed to?

    - Is it pleasurable to use?

-   What's missing is:

    - Did its design facilitate its manufacture and maintenance?

## What We Need

-   A vocabulary and canonical examples to ask and answer questions

-   Can this be build at a reasonable cost?

-   Will it hold up under constant use?

-   Will people understand how to use it?

-   Will they enjoy using it?

## Now It's Your Turn

-   I hope this book will help us get there

-   Because software *is* beautifulâ€”or can be

-   I hope your journey won't stop here
